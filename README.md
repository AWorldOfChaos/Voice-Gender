# Voice-Gender
---
This project was done as a part of the course CS337: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at IIT Bombay in the Autumn Semester of 2022.

## Problem Statement
The goal was to predict gender of the human specimen on the basis of the specimen voice. We tackled both aspects, predicting using the raw encoded audio files or using feature engineering utilising external devices. Target Classes - 'Male', 'Female'

## Datasets
1. VoiceGender Dataset
2. VoxCeleb Dataset

## Overview
We studied, analysed and compared various architectures for feature engineering and feature extraction from voice samples based on the Mel Feature Cepstral Coefficients as well as classification models for classifying the feature extracted samples into gender classes.
